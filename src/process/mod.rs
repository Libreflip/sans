//! (General) processing submodule for sans
//!
//! This module can be run in two different states. `local` and `remote`
//!
//! If in `remote` mode, all request calls will be routed to the external (remote) worker server
//! whereas in `local` mode sans will do all computations locally.
//!
//! This module also handles export tasks via an additional trait hook called [Export] which can be
//! hooked into a variety of web services or external API's.
//!
//! ## Design principles
//!
//!  - "Work" interface which can be used to implement LocalWorker and RemoteWorker
//!  - "Worker" interface which can be used to compute work locally or receive it via an API
//!  - "Scheduler" which is configured to either talk to a local worker
//!    or send the work to an external worker to process.
//!
//! ```
//!   Worker (local)   |   Worker
//!     ^^^           |     ^^^
//!   Scheduler        |   [Use worker API]
//!     ^^^           |     ^^^
//!     WORK          |   Scheduler
//!                   |     ^^^
//!                   |     WORK
//! ```
