//! sans-server â€“ Libreflip sans server daemon
//! 
//! The design principle for this software is taken from Aouglas Adams:
//!
//! > Don't Panic!
//!
//! Also something about towels.
//!
//! The daemon should never just stop. Every possible error needs to be wrapped
//! into a Result<_> and communicate them to the user interface. Any actual panic
//! is a condition in the operation that prevents communication with the UI. These
//! should however still be logged.
